<h1 style="color:black;">About the Music Data</h1>
   
<p>The data used in this web app is from CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/music/">here.</a> The data contains statistics about music from 1926 to 2010. Although this data is a little outdated from how there were more songs before 1926 and also, there have been more songs made after 2010. However, this data is very factual, and even though it is outdated, this data can be trusted.</p>

<p>One of the statistics reported the statistics of the tempo that was registered in BPM. The fastest BPM for a song ever was called, “Thousand,” the song writer was Moby and it was produced in 1992. Another fact that can be found in the dataset is that Paul McCartney had recored the most popular songs ever recorded by an artist which is 25. It can be shown with his hotness rating, which is how popular that song was at the peak of it and there is a rating from 0 to 2. Two being the most popular. </p>



<p> There was also a category that registered when the song was released. However, if the release date is not known then it is marked as 0. To navigate this dataset they made it into a file called the “Million Song Dataset.”<a href="http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/code/">(Source.)</a>In some scenarios a lot of songs can be similar, but you can use the "Million Song Dataset" to see if there are some differences. The similar aspects could be; if they have the same BPM or the time period of when the song starts to fade out, or even a lot of the time the song has the same Artist ID because it is just the same artist.</p>
