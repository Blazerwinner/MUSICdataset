<h1>Music Data</h1>
   
<p> There are a couple of interactive pages that are user-friendly, that are on Popularity of Genre, and Data by Artists.</p>

<p> The first page is about Popularity of Genre which tells us which genre of songs are the most popular. There are so many different types of genres, so to qualify for the graph the genre had to have a least 100 types of songs that applied to that genre.</p>

<p>The last page is about Data by Artists which tells us how many songs are in the dataset by this artist. Also it tells us what the hotness of their songs were as an average between all of the songs on the datasets. The hotness is is a number out of 1-10, 10 being very popular and 1 being not popular at all. Lastly this site will be able to tell you what type of the genre the artist sings or makes.
